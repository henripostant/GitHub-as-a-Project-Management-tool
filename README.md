# GitHub-as-a-Project-Management-tool

I'm planning on moving my projects on GIthub and use GitHub as a project-management tool. ‚öôÔ∏è
Among the things I contemplate doing are (in no spectific order) : 

-Generate report I can send via emails

-Tag contents with tags from
  
  -The GTD methodology : 
    -"Project"
    -"Action"
    -"Someday Maybe"
  
  -Some "GTD" tags of my own : 
    -To talk about next time et. 
    
  -Potential context-related lists (at the phone, offline etc.)
  -The name/recurring themes across the different projects I'm working on 
    -example : "Adrien", "Julien" "INRIA" etc. 
    

As of today my understanding of github is intuitive : I guess I could do most things I dream of when it comes to managing projects with this tool. 
More specifically I imagine that : 
 
  -With Gighub, everything has a url (or has it) 
    -This is üîë. Most tools I played with such as Trello or like-minded platforms do not have a url for anything. 
    This is quite problematic when you want to share just one element to someone and not your whole board/document/
    
  -I can edit/create nice documents with Markdown or other markup languages.
  
  -I can plug APIs/services/extensions/plugins to fetch and "push" data from other services such as Google products.
    
 Among ths things that I imagine must be done are : 
  -Some sort of translation from the Github terminology üêô to my usual vocabulary.
  Aka wrap my head around the main concepts of Github and not try to force some non-relevant practice.
    -This includes knowing which container to use = when to draw the line between different projects
      -(I want to re-employ/re-use as many "components" as possible across projects.)
      
 ### Side note 
 strong types could be of use to implemented GTD : 
 For example a "project" could not also be "something-unclear yet".
